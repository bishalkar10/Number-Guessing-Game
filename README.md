Hello ! This is the popular number guessing Game. I have added some extra functionalities to the game.     

Here you can just run the game in any python 3 interpreter. It doesn't require any additional dependencies.  
A Random number is set as default between 1 to 1000. Computer will ask user to guess a number. If it's correct then computer will congratulate you. If you guess higher or lesser number than constraints then it will raise an error. Please give it a try. It took a lot to do this.    

You find out 'small_value' and 'big_value' variables to tweek the game constraints.
